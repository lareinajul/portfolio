  <b>Things to Remember </b>
  A Texas Notary Public who is not an attorney is not licensed to practice law in Texas and may not give legal advice or accept fees for legal advice. Under the Texas Admin. Code 87.43, a Notary Public is prohibited by law to act in the capacity of an attorney, give advice in preparing legal documents, issue identification cards, distribute confidential information. A Texas notary may not perform any notarial act unless the signer is present.

  Our notaries are not attorneys.

  <p>We do not guarantee the truth or accuracy of the document.</p>
  <p>We have no obligation to verify the document’s content.</p>
  <p>We do not legalize or validate a document.</p>

  <div class="flex-item"><div class="colorbar green"></div><b>Reminders</b>
  If you call a notary to a location and the signer is unable to sign, the document is not complete, or other questionable circumstances prevail, you will still be liable for the travel/time fee as agreed when booking the appointment.
